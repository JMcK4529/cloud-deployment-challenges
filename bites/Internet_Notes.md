# Internet

## Ping
- What does `ping`'s `-o` flag do? Can you try it out?
    - The `-o` flag makes `ping` send a single ICMP packet request and wait for the response.
- Can you `ping` a domain like google.com?
    - Yes. We can `ping google.com`. A DNS lookup reveals the IP address which corresponds to google.com and then `ping`s that.
- What about diy.com? Why?
    - No. Some websites have firewall settings which prevent `ping`, probably to avoid D/DoS attacks like "ping of death", where oversized, fragmented packets are sent to the server and can cause errors as it tries to reassemble them.
- Can you ping your own computer? Is there any purpose to such a thing?
    - Yes. This could be a good idea for a couple of reasons:
        - Diagnosing network connectivity problems on the local machine
        - Checking that the hosts file is set up for localhost
- What does the `-f` flag do and why does the manual advise you not to use it?
    - The `-f` flag stands for "flood" and sends `ECHO_REQUEST`s as fast as possible. This could create some backlog in the network stack, affecting performance. For this reason, using `ping -f` externally could be considered an attempted network attack.
- Could a `ping` ever respond with more than one packet? Can you find a way to use `ping` such that it does?
    - Requests and responses have a 1:1 relationship, so there is no way to cause more than one response per `ping`.
    - However, `ping -c {number} {address}` will send `{number}` of packets to `{address}`. This results in `{number}` of responses, also.

## Traceroute
- How can we use traceroutes -q flag to speed up tracing a route?
    - `traceroute -q {number} {address}` sets the number of queries at each hop to `number`. The default is 3, but setting to 1 would reduce the time taken to trace the route.
- What does the -r flag for traceroute do? 
    - It traces a route to a host on an attached (directly connected) network.
    - An attached network here means that the machine calling traceroute can communicate with it without involving a router or switch.
- What about on ping?
    - The same bypassing of normal routing tables as with traceroute, only working with directly attached networks.
- When might it be useful?
    - The -r flag might be useful for testing connections between machines that ought to be in the same network segment or subnet.
    - Also, if the routing daemon (which is in charge of monitoring which connections are available for communication within a network) drops an interface (meaning that it no longer lists the interface in the routing tables), the -r flag can be used to probe the route anyway. This could identify issues related to the dropped interface/route.
- What techniques do High Frequency Trading systems use to minimise latency?
    - The time it takes for data to get from one place to another is called latency. Very low latency connections are desirable by various groups, but for High Frequency Trading in the finance industry it can mean huge sums of money.
    - Having the minimal physical distance between connection end points (i.e. minimise signal travel time).
    - Have well-optimised network switch use, so longer routes are used less frequently.
- Try to trace a route between your computer and every continent on Earth. Which continents are easy or hard to reach â€” and why?
    - I used geotraceroute.com to find some IP addresses coresponding with various countries.
    - Africa
        - 13.244.55.174, 19 hops; South Africa
    - Asia
        - 136.232.148.178, 64+ hops, not resolved; India
        - 125.214.190.223, 64+ hops, not resolved, Sri Lanka
        - 202.47.238.118, 17 hops; Thailand
    - Antarctica
        - Potentially not possible to trace to Antarctica, since connections there are handled via satellite.
    - Europe
        - 193.247.170.254, 13 hops; Switzerland
    - North America
        - 174.136.100.234, 16 hops; LA, USA
    - Oceania
        - 103.25.56.18, 28 hops; Australia
    - South America
        - 187.0.196.36, 19 hops; Brazil
- How does traceroute actually work out routes?
    - It sends packets with incrementally higher TTL, such that the TTL reaches 0 at each successive server. This triggers an ICMP Time Exceeded message to be returned, indicating that a server has been reached and providing the IP address (in most cases).
- What is a 'ttl'?
    - TTL is "time-to-live". This is the number of servers a packet can pass through before becoming invalid.
- What is a 'time exceeded' reply?
    - The ICMP Time Exceeded message is sent when a packet reaches a TTL of 0 and is discarded by the server. It contains information about the server (e.g. the server's IP address and information about the packet itself).

## Telnet
*The xf.mkrs.link connection did not work, so I tested with a socket run via Python.*
- What was telnet originaly used for?
    - Remotely accessing a command-line interface.
- Why should this not be done now?
    - Telnet transfers 7-bit ASCII and cannot encrypt plaintext well. It is not secure.
- What are the different layers of the Internet Protocol Stack?
    - Application Layer
        - Communicating between applications e.g. web browsers.
        - Messages from one end's application are readable by the application at the other end.
        - Protocols used here include: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
    - Transport Layer
        - Collects the application layer message and adds a header to form a segment.
        - A socket at the sending end of the transport layer passes the message to the network layer.
        - At the receiving end, the reverse happens.
        - Uses a port number to identify the correct socket/application.
    - Network Layer
        - Receives the message and destination from the transport layer.
        - Adds a header and trailer, then sends a datagram.
        - Protocols used include: IPv4 and IPv6. These are the IP addresses.
        - ICMP is also used, but only for error reporting (containing no message information).
    - Link Layer
        - Communication between switches, routers, etc. occurs here.
        - At this level, the data packet is called a frame.
        - Mostly implemented in network adapters/network interface cards.
    - Physical Layer
        - The physical connections between devices e.g. fibre-optic, ethernet, etc.
        - The frame is broken down into bits, transmitted, then reassembled at the receiving side.
- What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
    - TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols.
    - TCP is reliable and connection-oriented, meaning it establishes a connection before transmitting data.
    - UDP is less reliable, but fast. It sends data without checking for a connection.
- How does a 'packet frame segment diagram' relate to the different layers of the Internet Protocol Stack?
    - << Frame Header | Network Header | Transport Header | Data | Frame Trailer >>
    - Packet(  Frame<  Datagram{  Segment[  ~Data~  ]  }  >  )
- How does a TCP handshake work?
    - Synchronise: The client sends a TCP segment with the SYN flag set to the server. This indicates that the client is trying to establish a connection with the server.
    - Synchronise-Acknowledge: The server reads the original segment and checks that it was not damaged (by reference to a checksum). If this is the case, a segment is sent back to the client with both SYN and ACK flags set.
    - Acknowledge: The client receives the new segment, checks it, then acknowledges that data is correctly being sent from server to client by sending a segment with only the ACK flag set.
    - By using this 3-way handshake, it can be confirmed that data is being reliably sent and received in both directions.
- In TCP, what happens if a packet gets lost and how is this achieved?
    - Timeout and Retransmission
        - When a TCP segment is sent, a timer starts. If an acknowledgement is no received by the time the timer expires, the segment is re-sent.
    - Selective Repeat
        - Each sent packet has a sequence number. If any packet is not received, it is re-sent without the need to send any other packets again.
    - Fast Retransmit
        - If a packet is dropped for some reason, it can lead to duplicate acknowledgements.
        - If three duplicates are detected, this triggers a retransmission of the segment even if no timeouts have occurred.
    - Congestion Window
        - The number of bytes that can be sent at any one time. It is maintained and updated by the client.
        - There is also a sliding window which controls how much data is received by the server (by limiting what is sent).
        - The sliding window is adjusted based on feedback from the server.
        - The client sends data which is less than the congestion and receive (sliding) windows.
- Is it a problem if two packets in a WiFi network are transmitted simultaneously?
    - Yes. If two WiFi nodes try to send data at the same time, this can cause a collision.
    - There are collision detection and resolution procedures:
        - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA): check if the channel is busy, then transmit if clear.
        - Expect ACK packet for each frame transmission, assume collision if not received. Back off for a random time to avoid a loop of collisions, then try again.

## Curl
- What is TLS?
    - This stands for Transport Layer Security.
    - It uses encryption to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
- When have you used TLS today?
    - TLS is commonly used for HTTPS, so I use it whenever I use my web browser.
- What does BGP stand for?
    - Border Gateway Protocol. 
- What is BGP's purpose on the internet?
    - It is a protocol that outlines how autonomous systems (like internet service providers or content delivery networks - networks that have a common route to the internet) should organise communication traffic.
    - BGP determines the most efficient paths between networks and uses this to facilitate transmissions.
- What are the differences between HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2?
    - HTTP/1.0
        - Available methods: GET, POST, HEAD
        - No persistent connections (each request/response pair requires a new connection)
    - HTTP/1.1
        - Available methods: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, OPTIONS
        - Persistent connections introduced (several requests can be executed using a single connection)
        - Optional compression/decompression
    - HTTP/2.0
        - Available methods: as with HTTP/1.1
        - Request multiplexing introduced (so multiple requests can be sent simultaneously via the same connection)
        - Automatic compression/decompression
        - Server push introduced (proactively sends data to the client before requests)
- Can you use telnet to manually make a HTTP/1.1 request to http://www.example.org ?

- Without using a HTTP library, write a HTTP server that is fully featured enough to respond to requests from your web browser and have them displayed. For this you will need to understand the HTTP protocol, how to parse HTTP requests, and how to send responses.
    - A good attempt so far in HTTP_server.py
    - It works for simple GET requests with both a browser and telnet.

## Dig & Nslookup
- What is a CNAME record for?
    - The CNAME record is for a domain name that is an alias for another (canonical) name and they should link to the same IP address.
- What is an MX record for?
    - This is a mail exchange record which points to the server(s) responsible for handling email messages sent to the domain.
- What is a TXT record for? Can you find some examples for real domains out there?
    - This is a text record. It associates some text information with the domain.
    - This can include things like SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records, which dictate which mail servers may send emails on behalf of the domain. (This can help to prevent email spoofing.)
- What packets do nslookup and dig generate? Can you look at them using termshark?
    - By default, dig uses UDP, but can also be configured to use TCP if necessary (using the +tcp flag).
    - nslookup acts in the same way, with its TCP option being controlled via the 
- What is an AAAA record for? How does it fit into the growth of the Internet?
    - AAAA records correspond to the IPv6 address of a domain.
    - IPv6 addresses (each of which is 4 times larger than an IPv4 address) are being used as the internet grows to ensure that we do not run out of unique IP addresses for domains.

## Mkcert
- When is it appropriate to share your private key?
    - It is never appropriate to share a private key.
- What is meant by trusting or not trusting a certificate?
    - A browser typically has a store of trusted root certificates - which can be compared against the SSL certificate presented by a website.
    - If there is a matching root certificate in the store, the certificate is trusted.
    - To generate a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate, the following process is followed:
        - A certificate signing request (CSR) is generated by some website/etc. and sent to an certificate authority (CA) for signing. It includes the requester's public key, domain name, and other information.
        - The CA validates the certificate then applies a digital signatue to it by hashing the certificate data and encrypting it with their private key.
        - A browser that later receives the certificate and decrypts the signature with the CA's public key - which has previously been distributed in the browser's root certificate store. (This works because private(public(X)) == public(private(X)) == X.)
        - If the hash uncovered by the browser matches the original hash, the certificate is trusted.
- What is Let's Encrypt? What was its purpose and what impact has it had on the web?
    - Let's Encrypt is an open, free certificate authority.
    - It's purpose was to make it easier for site providers to enable secure, private internet use.
    - Encouraged adoption of HTTPS and automation of certificate provision.
    - Impact: more uptake of HTTPS and secure internet usage.
- What other protocols use public-key cryptography?
    - TLS
    - HTTPS
    - SSH
- So we can secure HTTP, but what about DNS? Can anyone see your DNS lookups and thus the domains you're intending to visit?
    - Yes. In fact, we can even use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to secure our DNS resolutions.
    - DoT (DNS over TLS) can also be used.
- Let's say I gained control of a router between you and your bank's website. When you connect via HTTPS and ask for the server's public key, in principle I might intercept this and send my own public key to you instead. Then when you encrypt your bank details, I can decrypt them with my private key. What technologies and systems prevent this? In what situation might they fail?
    - This is prevented by the digital signature method (mostly).
    - Since a digital signature from the certificate authority is signed with the CA's private key, it cannot be replicated by a MitM unless the CA is compromised.
 
## Docker
- How do you run a container in the background?
    - use the -d or --detached flag.
    - check for running containers using `docker ps`
    - `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash` would then allow for entering the container later
- How do you stop a container running in the background?
    - `docker stop <container_name>` or `docker stop <container_id>`
    - force stop using `kill` instead of `stop`
    - `docker rm <container_id>` will permanently remove the container
    - `docker run --rm -dit <image>` will remove the container when it stops, automatically
- If you save a file in the Linux Docker container, then quit the container, then start it again â€” is the file still there?
    - Yes, if I use `docker start -ai <container_id>`
    - No, if I 
- How can you make files outside of the container accessible inside the container?
    - Use a bind mount
- How can you persist files within a Docker container?
    - Use a volume: `docker volume create my_volume`
    - `docker run -it -v my_volume:/container/path ubuntu /bin/bash`
    - If the container was created without reference to the volume it will need to be updated to reference the volume
    - `docker container update --volume-add test_volume:/container/path <container_id>` where container/path is the path to wherever persisting files should be stored in the container
    - Alternatively, use a bind mount in place of the volume (which is managed by docker)
    - `docker run -it -v /host/path:/container/path ubuntu /bin/bash` links the container/path to the host/path on the host machine
- Docker can in principle containerise any application. Can you find any other interesting or useful containers out there?
    - Podman, rkt, containerd, Kubernetes (orchestrates containers, works with VS Code Dev Containers), LXC, Singularity
- What is a VS Code Dev Container? How can they support you and your teams to build software?
    - VS Code Dev Containers can be used in two main ways:
        1. Develop in a container using devcontainer.json within VSCode to create a full-time developing environment
        2. Attach a running container to inspect/edit/debug it.
    - Using the Dev Container makes the environment consistent, reproducible and platform-independent. This allows a dev team to collaborate more freely, as nothing will be limited by environment specific problems.
- Not all programs can run on all computers. Why is this? How does Docker handle this problem?
    - Docker uses a daemon to listen for Docker API requests, then manages construction of containers.
    - The containers communicate with the client OS via kernels that are designed to work with namespaces (similar to how Linux works).
    - The namespaces that docker uses provide isolation from the OS by providing a kind of snapshot view of important system resources.
